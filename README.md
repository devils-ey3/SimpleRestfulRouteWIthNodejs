# SimpleRestfulRouteWIthNodejs

This is a simple restful routes api which is developed by nodejs.

Here i use express as server framework,
bcrypt for cryptrography,
jsonwebtoken for authentication & authorization
multer for data storage & 
mongoose for database.

You have to run this project with nodemon because 
environment variable is set in nodemon.json file or 
you could update it via dotenv package.
